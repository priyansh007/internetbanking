# D3 Simple - Population vs GDP per capita
The purpose of this homework is to teach you some basic grammar and functionalities contained in D3.js:

* Loading two datasets
* Performing DOM selection
* Filtering data attributes and sorting using one attribute
* Creating axes
* Adding a legend
* Using the D3 domain, range, and scale functions
* Adding axis labels
* Creating bar chart in circle
* Create two different charts with one X domain.

The starter codes for homework assignments uses D3 v7. You should use D3 v7 for your homeworks and project. If you are referencing online code tutorials, keep in mind that syntax may slightly change between versions! Be sure to also check the latest D3 documentation.




## Data and Chart Description

This assignment uses two csv files in the `Data/` folder: `gdp-per-capita-worldbank.csv` and `population-since-1800.csv`. Population CSV contains population of every countries from year 1800 to year 2021. GDP per capita csv contains country names and their gdp from year 2002 to year 2020. You will create circular bar chart graph for GDP per capita and population of most 50 populous country for year 2020.

## To start the assignment

* Clone this code to your local machine.
* Using a local server (such as HTTP Simple Server), open the **js/home.js** file. Remember, homeworks will be graded using Firefox and Python's HTTP Simple Server.
* Modify the source code according to the instructions below.
* Commit and push the code back to this repository to submit your assignment. The finished page in `index.html` should look like this:

## Assignment Steps

### Step 0: 
In the HTML file's `head` section, add your name and email.

### Step 1:
In the HTML file, there is a div with the id `my_dataviz`. Create an `svg` element inside this div. The `svg` should have a width of 1000 px and a height of 800 px.

> 🔍 **Note:** You can add the `svg` directly in the HTML or via Javascript in the `js/main.js` file.


### Step 2:
In `home.js`, `gdp-per-capita-worldbank.csv` and `population-since-1800.csv` files are loaded. Once the data is loaded,  store it in one or more global variables.

Since D3 doesn't have any information about the attribute types of the new files, it interprets every data value as a string. To use the quantatitive columns as such, you'll need to do some data wrangling to convert each row of the data to the correct numeric format. 
Create a array having json object with three variables - countryName, gdpPerCapita and population for year 2020. Sort Array using population and use top 50 countries for visualization.

### Step 3:
Next, create the x- and two y-axes for your chart. The x-axis will show country name, so we will use a `d3.scaleBand` for it. The first y-axis will show population of country, so we will use `d3.scaleRadial`. Second y-axis will show gdp per capita, it will also use `d3.scaleRadial`. Use innerCircle radius = 100 and outerCircle radius = 400. Use color of your choice for both plots.
 
 The first y-axis range will be 0 to maximum value of population, and the second y-axis range will be 0 to the maximum gdp per capita.

> 🔍 **Hint:** You'll need to use D3 `range` and `domain` to do this.

### Step 4:
Next, create the x- and two y-axes for your chart. The x-axis will show country name, so we will use a `d3.scaleBand` for it. The first y-axis will show population of country, so we will use `d3.scaleRadial`. Second y-axis will show gdp per capita, it will also use `d3.scaleRadial`. Use innerCircle radius = 100 and outerCircle radius = 400. Use color of your choice for both plots.
 
 The first y-axis range will be 0 to maximum value of population, and the second y-axis range will be 0 to the maximum gdp per capita. 

> 🔍 **Hint:** You'll need to use D3 `range` and `domain` to do this.


### Step 5:
It’s important to help your audience understand what is going on in the chart. To do this, add a legend at the upper left corner of the chart. The legend should have a square showing the colors, with labels reading "GDP per capita" and "Population". 



### Extra Credit:

Instead of simply static chart, use D3 interaction to increase the size of the bar when hovered by mobile pointer. This step is worth +2 extra credit points.
